# ESP8266 Web Server - Internet Exposure

**Date:** 19-Jan-2024 | 29-Dey-1402  
**Author:** Mohammad Reza Reihani

## Version 0.1.0

### Introduction

In this version, I experimented with a basic web server for the ESP8266 hardware and successfully exposed it to the internet. The primary goal was to make the server accessible not only within the local network but also from the internet. This involved understanding and implementing port forwarding concepts.

### Key Learnings

1. **Port Forwarding:** Explored the concept of port forwarding, a crucial step in making a local server accessible from the internet.
2. **ISP Restrictions:** Discovered that some ISPs may impose restrictions on port forwarding, requiring the purchase of a static IP for external access.

### Implementation Details

- Used an example of a basic web server for the ESP8266.
- Configured port forwarding on the router to allow external access.
- Investigated the need for a static IP from the ISP for successful port forwarding.

### Future Plans

In upcoming versions, the focus will be on exploring practical applications of ESP8266 web servers, investigating the existence of frameworks, and assessing the feasibility of streaming a camera feed. Additionally, considerations for implementing authentication will be explored.

Stay tuned for more updates and improvements!
